Freelancer is an upcoming puzzle/management video game in which players assume the role of a freelancing graphic designer. The game's puzzle mechanics draw inspiration from the field of graphic design, with players receiving prompts that require them to create graphic designs using a simplified interface. The game also features an algorithm that analyzes the color scheme and composition choices made by the player, allowing them to obtain a perfect score by fulfilling all of the requirements given by the prompts, requiring both logical problem-solving skills and artistic sensibility.

In addition to the puzzle gameplay, Freelancer features a management aspect where players must balance their graphic design work with the needs of the designer's personal life. For example, the higher a player's graphic design score, the more money they make, but taking too long to perfect a design can negatively affect the designer's health and require costly medication.

The narrative design of Freelancer draws inspiration from the indie game "Papers, Please" and embeds the story within the gameplay. Players will encounter moral dilemmas as they navigate a world where technological and cultural trends are constantly shifting.

Overall, Freelancer promises to be an engaging and challenging game that combines puzzle-solving and management gameplay mechanics with a thought-provoking story.

Freelancer has been in development since February 2023 using Unity Engine 2021.3.6.f. The game's design, coding, art, and story are all the work of Zi Di Zhu.
